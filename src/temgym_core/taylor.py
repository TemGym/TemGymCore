    Parameters:
      multi_index_array: dict
          Dictionary whose keys are variable names and values are lists of terms.
          Each term is a list where the first n entries are the exponents for each
          independent symbol, and the last entry is the coefficient.
      var_list: str or list of str
          The key or keys in multi_index_array for which to form the polynomial.
      sym_vars: list of sympy.Symbol, optional
          The symbols to be used in the polynomial. If None, defaults to generic symbols
          x0, x1, ..., x{n-1}.

    Returns:
      sympy.Expr or dict: If a single variable is provided, returns the simplified sympy expression.
