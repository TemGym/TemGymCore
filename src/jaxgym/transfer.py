def transfer_rays_pt_src(input_pos_xy, input_slopes_xy, transfer_matrix):
    """
    Propagate rays through an optical system using the provided transfer matrix.
    This function takes an initial point source position (x, y) and their corresponding
    slopes, constructs a ray vector, and propagates these rays through the system by
    applying the transfer matrix. The output is a set of propagated ray coordinates.
    Parameters
    ----------
    input_pos_xy : tuple
        A tuple (input_pos_x, input_pos_y) representing the x and y coordinates of the
        source position.
    input_slopes_xy : tuple
        A tuple (input_slopes_x, input_slopes_y) representing the slopes of the rays
        in the x and y directions.
    transfer_matrix : numpy.ndarray
        A matrix used to propagate the rays. It should be compatible with the constructed
        ray vector so that the dot product results in a propagated coordinate array.
    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        A 2D numpy array of shape (4, N) where N is the number of rays. The rows correspond to:
            - x positions
            - y positions
